The work I've been doing for the last 20 years has been heavily influenced by this background, from the fundamentals I learned from an Industrial Designer degree I took in 2002, and the various experiences and projects I've gone through in my professional career.

At the beginning of my career, I worked as a product designer for the ceramic and glass industry, where I create a series of pieces for tableware and decoration.

In the same period, I started helping architects and landscape designers with 3D visualizations. This dragged me into big scale, work-intensive CAD projects. I learned a lot about the importance of putting all the pieces together to achieve a goal and the symbiotic relationship between architects and engineering, creativity, and science. I still use these learnings today, when I'm working on complex digital projects.

My transition to digital was natural at some point. I self-taught myself HTML and CSS and started working in a small agency building websites for clients. The Internet became my passion. I never stopped working on digital products ever since.

 I was also very fortunate to be able to work with amazing people, some of the very best in their fields, along my path. Being close to them was contagious and allowed me to experience the launch of impactful products to end-users.

To be honest, I find it hard to put my path as a designer in writing today. I have worn many hats, and I feel that my core skills lie between the experiences I gathered in designing, doing creative thinking, and teamwork. 

My ultimate goal is to deliver practical and beautiful experiences to end-users. Whether it is a chair, a ceramic cup, a brand, or an app, it has to fulfill all functionalities expected and be aesthetically pleasing. In the portfolio section, I highlight some of my work. I hope you enjoy it.
