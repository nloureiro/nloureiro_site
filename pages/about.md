I was born and raised in the old part of Lisbon. Walking through century-old streets as a kid, looking at the Portuguese colors and the tiles in the buildings, and living the open-minded metropolis culture of my hometown in this little European corner inspired me.

The work I've been doing for the last 20 years has been heavily influenced by this background and by experiences like an Industrial Designer degree I got in 2002 and the various projects I've gone through in my professional career.

At the beginning of my career, in 1998, I worked as a product designer for the ceramic and glass industry, where I created a series of pieces for tableware and decoration.

In 2002, I started helping architects and landscape designers with 3D visualizations. This brought me to big scale CAD/3D projects. I learned a lot about the importance of putting all the pieces together to achieve a goal and the symbiotic relationship between architects and engineering, creativity, and science.

I still use these learnings today, when I'm working on complex digital projects.

In 2003 my transition to digital was a natural one. I taught myself HTML and CSS and started working in a small agency building websites for clients. The Internet became my passion, and I've been working on digital products ever since.

At [Sapo](https://www.sapo.pt/), 2009 to 2016, I led design teams and was very fortunate to work with amazing people - some of the very best in their fields. Together we were able to launch very impactful products that reached an international scale.

The latest big challenge in my career was to co-found [Bright Pixel](https://brpx.com/) and lead the creative department. I worked directly with startups, and big companies rethinking their digital product experience. It was an immensely rewarding experience that broadened my knowledge of business, marketing, and strategy.
