I was born and raised in the old part of Lisbon. Walking through century-old streets as a kid, looking at the Portuguese colors and the tiles in the buildings, and living the open-minded metropolis culture of my hometown in this little European corner inspired me.

The work I've been doing for the last 20 years has been heavily influenced by this background and by experiences like an Industrial Designer degree I got in 2002 and the various projects I've gone through in my professional career.

At the beginning of my career, in 1998, I worked as a product designer for the ceramic and glass industry, where I created a series of pieces for tableware and decoration.

In 2002, I started helping architects and landscape designers with 3D visualizations. This brought me to big scale CAD/3D projects. I learned a lot about the importance of putting all the pieces together to achieve a goal and the symbiotic relationship between architects and engineering, creativity, and science.

I still use these learnings today, when I'm working on complex digital projects.

In 2003 my transition to digital was a natural one. I taught myself HTML and CSS and started working in a small agency building websites for clients. The Internet became my passion, and I've been working on digital products ever since.

At Sapo, 2009 to 2016, I was also very fortunate to work with amazing people, some of the very best in their fields. Being close to them allowed me to experience the launch of impactful products to end-users and lead the design team in some of them that reach an international scale.

The latest big challenge in my career was to co-found Bright Pixel and lead the creative department. I worked directly with startups, and big companies rethinking their digital product experience. It was an immensely rewarding experience that broadened my knowledge of business, marketing, and strategy. 

Because of all this, I find it hard to put my path as a designer in writing. I have worn many hats, and I feel that my core skills lie between the experiences I gathered in designing, doing creative thinking, and teamwork.

My ultimate goal is to deliver practical and beautiful experiences to end-users. Whether it is a chair, a ceramic cup, a brand, or an app, it must fulfill all expected functionalities and be aesthetically pleasing. In the portfolio section, I highlight some of my work. I hope you enjoy it. 

Check the [portfolio section](portfolio) where I highlight some of the work, if you really need here is my [CV](assets/cv.pdf), and if you have any questions, feel free to send me as [email](mailto:mail@nloureiro.com).

Thank you for your time and enjoy :)
